### Content

The page was made using HTML and CSS. I tried to make it responsive to various screen sizes (still a work in progress) and interesting by adding affects to the images and links, such as hover, transform etc.
I am sure I will make many improvments on this as the weeks and months go by! Glad I have a starting place where I can look back on and see how much I have accomplished over time.
